 <h1> Thoughts on Intevitale Pain </h1>

   The paper titled The Inevitable Pain of Software Development,
Including of Extreme Programming,Caused by Requirements Volatility is written by Daniel Berry. Berry is a faculty member of Computer Science for the University of Waterloo. Berry claims that all programmer have steps of programming that they dislike and avoid, which of course causes problems. He explains that the real problem of software engineering is dealing with ever changing requirements. However, there is no tool or method yet proven to have fixed this problem. Berry continues to say that a method has not been made because the hardest part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build. Furthermore, he claims that no major improvement in the software engineering area will ever appear. 
	Berry recalls Michael Jackson speaking at the 1994 International conference on requirement engineering and saying that only two things are know about requirements which are that they will change and that they will be misunderstood. Berry follows up by stating that there is no way that requirements are not gonna change. Moreover, statistics show that a large majority of changes to a computer based system (CBS) is due to requirement changes. In addition, legacy programs tend to decay more as more changes are implemented. Simply the program becomes messy. Berry claims that to fix or stop the decay that the solution is to typically revert back to last best version of the program. Nevertheless, requirements have changed so much since the initial commitment to the architecture that the architecture has had to be changed so much that it becomes brittle. If the program become brittle it becomes very hard to accommodate new or changed requirements with out breaking the CBS. 
Methods have been designed to fix the issues of brittleness and and CBS breakdown. However, each method has a fatal flaw. The  methods named to overcome said difficulties are the build-and-fix, water fall, and structured programming. The models mentioned are requirements engineering, extreme programming, and program generation. Overall, Berry explains that no matter which method or model you use to program that it is always going to be hard. There will never be a quick and easy fix. 
  	I believe that Berry is correct. Programming has not proven to be easy in the past and continues to prove difficult today. Computer science is one of the most demanded career fields with the least amount of participants. If programming was easy the salary base for computer scientist wouldn't be as high as it is and most bosses watching over software release dates would sleep easier at night. However, Berry and Jackson share a pessimistic outlook on the software engineering destiny. I believe that software is not doomed forever, and that it will get better as the human race continuous to evolve.
