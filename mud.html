  <h2> Thoughts on the Big Ball of Mud Theory </h2>
  
  
<textarea cols="75" rows="50"> 
	The paper Big Ball of Mud by  Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder explains that producing messy software is okay as long as it works and is on time instead of putting off a launch in order for it to be perfect. The authors argue that the time spent on developing a perfect software program takes away from time that could be spent on getting feed back from users. Feed back is essential to a successful program because it lets developers know what works and what doesn't for example. In addition, a programmer can make a beautifully coded program but that doesn't mean people will like it or use it. Feedback allows programmers to know which programs are being used and which have a practical application  since there is no point in producing software that no ones utilizes. 
	I agree completely with the authors. I hope to utilize this method in the feature. I believe that it can be nerve racking at times to produce a program. Especially in a world where perfectionism is rampant. However, the idea that it takes feed back, positive or negative, to produce the true “perfect program” is something we all must strive for in order to be successful.
