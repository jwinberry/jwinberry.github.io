  <h2> Guided Reading in CODE </h2>
  <br><br>
  
The reading in Code builds up to how we can use binary and transistors to build a computer. Essentially the history of representing information using alternative methods such as Morse code and Braille, were technology breakthroughs. Automating alternative information representations with electricity continued this progress.

1. Briefly describe the four gates explained in Chapter 11. Describe the behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.
a) AND gate is a gate that has 2 inputs and one out put. A light bulb (output) is only lit when both relays (inputs) are triggered. If either input is turned on (but not both) the lightbulb(output) turns off. 
b) OR gate is a gate that has 2 inputs and one output. A light bulb (output) is only lit when one or the other relays (inputs) are triggered. Or if both inputs are triggered.  
c) NOR (opposite of OR) gate is a gate that has 2 inputs and one output. When both of the inputs are off, the lightbulb (output) turns on. If both inputs are turned on the lightbulb (output) turns off.
d) NAND (opposite of AND) gate is a gate that has 2 inputs and one output. It is a gate when both inputs are on the lightbulb (output) turns off. When one or the other inputs is turned on (but not both) the lightbulb(output) turns on.

2. A half adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?

<li> Sub components: (2) XOR & AND </li>
<li> Inputs: 2 </li>
<li> Outputs: 1 </li>
</ol>
<ol>
3. A full adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?
<li> Sub components: (3) 2 half adders, 1 OR gate </li>
<li> Inputs: 4 </li>
<li> Outputs: 2 </li>
</ol>

<ol>
4. How many total inputs and outputs are there for an 8-bit adding circuit?

<li> We need 8 full adders for our 8-bit adding machine. 
<li>Inputs: 32 
<li>Outputs: 16
</ol>

<ol>

5. How many total transistors are needed for the ripple version of the 8-bit adder?
<ol>
<li> 144 ! and even more if you replace the ripple carry with a look-ahead carry.
