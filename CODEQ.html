  <h2> Guided Reading in CODE </h2>
  <br><br>
  
The reading in Code builds up to how we can use binary and transistors to build a computer. Essentially the history of representing information using alternative methods such as Morse code and Braille, were technology breakthroughs. Automating alternative information representations with electricity continued this progress.

<h3> Chapter 11 </h3>
<p>
<ul>
1. Briefly describe the four gates explained in Chapter 11. Describe the behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.

<li> AND gate is a gate that has 2 inputs and one out put. A light bulb (output) is only lit when both relays (inputs) are triggered. If either input is turned on (but not both) the lightbulb(output) turns off. </li>
<li>OR gate is a gate that has 2 inputs and one output. A light bulb (output) is only lit when one or the other relays (inputs) are triggered. Or if both inputs are triggered.  </li>
<li> NOR (opposite of OR) gate is a gate that has 2 inputs and one output. When both of the inputs are off, the lightbulb (output) turns on. If both inputs are turned on the lightbulb (output) turns off.</li>
<li> NAND (opposite of AND) gate is a gate that has 2 inputs and one output. It is a gate when both inputs are on the lightbulb (output) turns off. When one or the other inputs is turned on (but not both) the lightbulb(output) turns on. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Chapter 12 </h3>
<ul>
2. A half adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?

<li> Sub components: (2) XOR & AND </li>
<li> Inputs: 2 </li>
<li> Outputs: 1 </li>
</ul>
<ul>
3. A full adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?
<li> Sub components: (3) 2 half adders, 1 OR gate </li>
<li> Inputs: 4 </li>
<li> Outputs: 2 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
4. How many total inputs and outputs are there for an 8-bit adding circuit?

<li> We need 8 full adders for our 8-bit adding machine. 
<li>Inputs: 32 
<li>Outputs: 16
</ul>

<ul>

5. How many total transistors are needed for the ripple version of the 8-bit adder?
<ul>
<li> 144 ! and even more if you replace the ripple carry with a look-ahead carry. 
</ul>
