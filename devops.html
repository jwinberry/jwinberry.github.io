	Devops is a software engineering method meant to to unite software development and software operations. Organizations are starting to embrace approaches to software development that put the customer front and center. DevOps facilitates customer satisfaction by increased frequency of software delivery and response time to customer feedback by employing  automation and monitoring at all steps of software  creation.   . A key concern for most looking to adopt the DevOps approach is the capability of DevOps to enable their business transformation through faster development of innovative software that meets emerging business needs.
	However, DevOps was designed to keep the development cycle of software to run at high speeds and still remain cost efficient. To have the software meet its efficiency goals DevOps employs design thinking(usability) , a lean start up, analytics, and security by eliminating vulnerabilities from the application before they reach production, just to name a few. 
	DevOps typically requires a shift in mindset. It has individuals turn away from isolated development teams and rigid silos towards collaborative practices. In addition, the typically successful DevOps organizations embraces a positive and creatively stimulating workplace, small autonomous  teams to deliver software, transparency with metrics, and an workspace where developers can make mistakes fast and not be penalized for it. 
    Overall, I believe the Devops method to be progress and practical. The DevOps method strongly promotes harmony between  businesses, its leaders, the engineers, and the software. The components of DevOps are straight forward . The method has heavy emphasis on making the software development and operations personal .
