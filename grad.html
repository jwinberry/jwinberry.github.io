  <h2>  --UC Davis-- </h2>
  <br>
  Davis offers BS, MS, and PhD degree options for computer science students. 
  <br>
  The student learning outcomes are: 
  <br> 
  <ol>
<li> an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, computing, and engineering</li>
<li> an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data</li>
<li> an ability to design, implement, and evaluate a system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs, within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability</li>
<li> an ability to function on multi-disciplinary teams</li>
<li> an ability to identify, formulate, and solve computer science and engineering problems and define the computing requirements appropriate to their solutions</li>
<li> an understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilities</li>
<li> an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences</li>
<li> the broad education necessary to understand the impact of computer science and engineering solutions in a global and societal context</li>
<li>a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning</li>
<li>knowledge of contemporary issues</li>
<li>an ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing and engineering practice
<li>an ability to apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science and engineering theory in the modeling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design choices</li>
<li>an ability to apply design and development principles in the construction of software systems or computer systems of varying complexity</li>

<br><br> For obtaining your masters degrees you have 3 options: Thesis, Project, or Exam.

<h2> --UDC--</h2>
<br>
The University of the District of Columbia offers BS and MS degree options for Computer Science.
<br> 
The student learning outcomes are: 
<br>
<ol>
<li>An ability to apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline</li>
<li>An ability to analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution</li>
<li>An ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs</li>
<li>An ability to function effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal</li>
<li>An understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilities</li>
<li>An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences</li>
<li>An ability to analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society</li>
<li>Recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in continuing professional development</li>
<li>An ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice</li>
<li>An ability to apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory in the modeling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design choices</li>
<li>An ability to apply design and development principles in the construction of software systems of varying complexity</li>
</ol>
<br><br> 
For obainting your Masters Degree you have two options: 
<br>
<ul>
<li>The program offers a thesis option and a non-thesis option. Students in both options must take four graduate computer science (CS) core courses. Students who wish to write a thesis take four graduate CS electives and sign up for 6 thesis credits (counts as two graduate electives) whereas students in the non-thesis option must take six graduate CS electives. One of these six electives can be CSCI 599 Master's Project.</li>
